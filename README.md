# Eye_Movement_Project
## Week 8 Module

### Description
In this project, we implement HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive pair of eyes that follow a cursor's movement within the window.

### Future Outlook
This project will most likely be revisited to try and implement a few more things such as trying to integrate some other facial features.
